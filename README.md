# GMTK-2020

This year's theme is... *Out of Control*!

This untitled game is a stealth invasion where you have to sneak past guards, setting up the path for your escape along the way.

The problem is, your character is far too greedy and is constantly moving toward the goal whether you want to or not. Before each step, you have the chance to pick up an item and set it down somewhere else. This lets you choose your path, set traps, and be prepared for when you get caught or get your prize, because when you do, *your character stops trusting you and just wants to get the hell out of there!*. 

Prepare your path, foil your enemies, and get the hell out there!
